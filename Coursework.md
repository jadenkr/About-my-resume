# Stanford University Courses
## EE 153: Power Electronics
### Professor Juan Rivas
Addressing the energy challenges of today and the environmental challenges of the future will require efficient energy conversion techniques. This course will discuss the circuits used to efficiently convert ac power to dc power, dc power from one voltage level to another, and dc power to ac power. The components used in these circuits (e.g., diodes, transistors, capacitors, inductors) will also be covered in detail to highlight their behavior in a practical implementation. A lab will be held with the class where students will obtain hands on experience with power electronic circuits

## EE 156: Board Level Design
### Professor Steven Clark
The ability to rapidly create board level electronics at prototype and short run volumes is enabling; Board Level Design teaches how to do this. This course focuses on applying circuit design concepts to rapidly create electronics to augment existing research instruments, explore and reduce technical risk, and provide engineering samples for evaluation. Students will send several PCBs for fabrication during the Quarter. The PCBs will be "brought-up" and tested to confirm functionality and performance to specification. Undergraduate EE majors will gain deeper exposure to circuits and planar electromagnetics.
