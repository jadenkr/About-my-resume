## EE 153: Power Electronics
### Professor Juan Rivas-Davilla
Addressing the energy challenges of today and the environmental challenges of the future will require efficient energy conversion techniques. This course will discuss the circuits used to efficiently convert ac power to dc power, dc power from one voltage level to another, and dc power to ac power. The components used in these circuits (e.g., diodes, transistors, capacitors, inductors) will also be covered in detail to highlight their behavior in a practical implementation. A lab will be held with the class where students will obtain hands on experience with power electronic circuits

## EE 156: Board Level Design
### Professor Steven Clark
The ability to rapidly create board level electronics at prototype and short run volumes is enabling; Board Level Design teaches how to do this. This course focuses on applying circuit design concepts to rapidly create electronics to augment existing research instruments, explore and reduce technical risk, and provide engineering samples for evaluation. Students will send several PCBs for fabrication during the Quarter. The PCBs will be "brought-up" and tested to confirm functionality and performance to specification. Undergraduate EE majors will gain deeper exposure to circuits and planar electromagnetics.

## EE 156: Introduction to Micro and Nano Electromechanical Systems
### Professor Roger Howe and Olav Solgaard
Miniaturization technologies now have important roles in materials, mechanical, and biomedical engineering practice, in addition to being the foundation for information technology. This course will target an audience of first-year engineering graduate students and motivated senior-level undergraduates, with the goal of providing an introduction to M/NEMS fabrication techniques, selected device applications, and the design tradeoffs in developing systems.

## EE 101B: Circuits I
### Professor Simon Wong
Introduction to circuit modeling and analysis. Topics include creating the models of typical components in electronic circuits and simplifying non-linear models for restricted ranges of operation (small signal model); and using network theory to solve linear and non-linear circuits under static and dynamic operations.

## EE 101B: Circuits II
### Professor Simon Wong
Introduction to circuit design for modern electronic systems. Modeling and analysis of analog gain stages, frequency response, feedback. Filtering and analog to digital conversion. Fundamentals of circuit simulation. 

## ME 210: Introduction to Mechatronics
### Professor Thomas Kenny and Karl Gumerlock
Technologies involved in mechatronics (intelligent electro-mechanical systems), and techniques to apply this technology to mecatronic system design. Topics include: electronics (A/D, D/A converters, op-amps, filters, power devices); software program design, event-driven programming; hardware and DC stepper motors, solenoids, and robust sensing. Large, open-ended team project.

## EE 116: Semiconductor Devices for Energy and Electronics
### Professor Srabanti Chowdhury
The underpinnings of modern technology are the transistor (circuits), the capacitor (memory), and the solar cell (energy). EE 116 introduces the physics of their operation, their historical origins (including Nobel prize breakthroughs), and how they can be optimized for future applications. The class covers physical principles of semiconductors, including silicon and new material discoveries, quantum effects, band theory, operating principles, and device equations.

## EE 157: Electric Motors for Renewable Energy, Robotics, and Electric Vehicles
### Professor Steven Clark
An introduction to electric motors and the principles of electromechanical energy conversion. Students will learn about, design, and build an electric motor system, choosing from one of three application areas: renewable energy (wind turbines), robotics (drones and precision manufacturing), or electric vehicles (cars, ships, and airplanes). Topics covered include ac and dc rotating machines, power electronics inverters and drives, and control techniques.

## CS 106B: Programming Abstractions
### Professor Cynthia Lee
Abstraction and its relation to programming. Software engineering principles of data abstraction and modularity. Object-oriented programming, fundamental data structures (such as stacks, queues, sets) and data-directed design. Recursion and recursive data structures (linked lists, trees, graphs). Introduction to time and space complexity analysis. Uses the programming language C++ covering its basic facilities.

## DATASCI 112: Principles of Data Science
### Professor Dennis Sun
A hands-on introduction to the principles and methods of data science. This course is designed to equip you with tools to begin extracting insights and making decisions from data in the real world, as well as to prepare you for further study in statistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. We will analyze and visualize data of different shapes and sizes (e.g., tabular, textual, hierarchical, geospatial). We will discuss common patterns and pitfalls of data analysis. We will build and evaluate machine learning models, focusing on general concepts (rather than specific methods), including supervised vs. unsupervised learning, training vs. testing error, hyperparameter tuning, and ensemble methods. The focus will be on intuition and implementation, rather than theory and math. Implementation will be in Python and Jupyter notebooks, using libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn. This course culminates in a project where you apply the ideas to a data science problem of your choosing.
