# EE 153 Power Electronics Senior Project: Flyback Converter for Phone Chargers

### Abstract
Welcome to my repository showcasing my senior project in power electronics at Stanford University! This IEEE project report focuses on the design and analysis of flyback converters, which are essential DC-DC converters commonly employed in phone chargers. Join me as we explore the critical components and design considerations involved in creating an efficient and safe phone charging solution.

### Overview
Flyback converters play a crucial role in powering modern devices, such as smartphones. At the core of these converters lies the transformer, responsible for providing voltage isolation and step-down functionality, ensuring the charging of low voltage devices. Throughout this project, we delve into the intricate details of transformer design, including factors like winding turn ratio and magnetizing inductance, which significantly influence its performance.

To control the power flow through the transformer, I employ a MOSFET switch, requiring precise triggering for efficient operation. By carefully managing the duty cycle, we optimize the charging process while maintaining device safety.
### Objectives
**Efficiency Optimization:** Through systematic experimentation, we explore the relationship between input voltage and power efficiency. By analyzing the data, we gain valuable insights into designing more efficient phone chargers, where the output power closely matches the input power.

**Simulation-Driven Design:** Harnessing the power of simulation circuits, we establish a reliable foundation for our design process. These simulations provide invaluable guidance, enabling us to anticipate circuit behavior and make informed decisions before moving on to physical manufacturing.
