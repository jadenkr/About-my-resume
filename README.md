# Jaden Redhair's Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my engineering portfolio! This repository serves as an overview of my projects and academic achievements in the field of electrical engineering.
Here, you'll find information about my senior project in power electronics from my EE153 class, as well as a document detailing my coursework and class descriptions.

## ðŸŒŸ Senior Project: Power Electronics (EE153)

In my senior project for the EE153 course, I took on the captivating challenge of power electronics, where I personally built my own flyback converter and wound the
transformer from scratch. With a hands-on approach, I simulated the circuit in LTspice, prototyped the board, and conducted precise lab measurements. This
comprehensive project showcases my expertise in working with transformers, MOSFET switches, and simulation tools to achieve high-efficiency power conversion.
Specifically, I delved into the design and analysis of flyback converters, essential components in DC-DC conversion for various applications. The meticulous
research, experimentation, and simulation involved focused on optimizing the efficiency of flyback converters for phone chargers.
